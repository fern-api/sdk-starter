## Requirements

- Node 18 or higher
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- The [Fern GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/fern-api) installed

### Step 1: Use this template

1. Click on the **Use this template** button (found at the top right of this page). You must be logged into GitHub.
2. Choose the option to **create a new repository**. Name it whatever you'd like.

### Step 2: Clone and configure the repo

1. Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Open `fern.config.json` and update the `organization` field with your organization name.

```json
{
  "organization": "your-organization-name",
  "version": "0.57.2"
}
```

### Step 3: Install and configure Fern

1. Install the Fern CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

2. Log in to Fern:
```bash
fern login
```

### Step 4: Configure your SDK settings

The repository comes pre-configured for TypeScript and Python SDK generation in `generators.yml`. You'll need to:

1. Create a GitHub repository for each SDK you want to generate
2. Install the [Fern GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/fern-api) in your target repository. 
3. Uncomment and update the GitHub section in `generators.yml` with your repository information:

```yaml
# For Python SDK
github:
  repository: your-org/your-python-sdk-repo

# For TypeScript SDK
github:
  repository: your-org/your-typescript-sdk-repo
```

### Step 5: Generate your SDKs

To generate and publish your SDKs:
```bash
fern generate --group python-sdk
```
AND
```bash
fern generate --group ts-sdk
```

The generated SDKs will be:
- Committed to your specified GitHub repositories
- Published to npm (TypeScript) and PyPI (Python) if configured
- Version-controlled using semantic versioning

## Customization Options

The starter comes with some pre-configured options in `generators.yml`:

You can modify these configurations or add additional options by editing `generators.yml`.
